The team made sure to make me a part of the whole process of getting my ring made . Cross checking on each point what I want my budget, the delivery possibilities on my zip code , my doubts on purchasing my first lab grown diamond ring . Even when he was on leave he made sure to receive my calls and get my doubts sorted . For those who are thinking  of getting your first piece of lab grown diamond jewellery made please get to them blindly and just trust them with your dream . The quality is to die for , every time my ring shines ,it gets a big big smile on my face . Thank you earthly jewels and get ready for my many more orders ü•Ç"

They are extremely enthusiastic and truly committed to delivering 200% customer satisfaction. A special shoutout to Lokesh Kochar, who was incredibly supportive and understanding of my needs ‚Äî he went above and beyond to source not just the right size but also the right quality diamonds to ensure a perfect match, even though 0.07ct stones are quite rare to find. Instead of settling, he continued to scout for the best.\nThe designer was also very patient, accommodating every change I requested with great care.\nA huge thanks to the entire team for their patience, dedication, and genuine interest in making my dream ring a reality!"

And would also get more stuffs soon just for my family.\n\nFor others who are in same dilemma as me, their price was the best that i found across mumbai, mangalore and bangalore (considering the 4cs). Other stores i went in bangalore had a high markup for same configuration but these guys are genuine with good pricing."

They manufacture their own diamonds, and as such they give you the actual price, no middlemen cuts! You get the absolute most value for every pound you spend. I stumbled into their website after going around in circles with many UK, US, Indian and Thai jewelers looking for the best deal for the carat I wanted, and then I saw found them. I couldn't get the ring I wanted on their website (I wanted the ring metal to be platinum), so I sent a message to them via the WhatsApp link on their website (I know, I was worried as well that this could be disastrous), and their staff on the other end were so patient and professional with understanding my requirements, keeping updated all through the process and sending me the ring! And the ring came with its IGI certificate, and I just got the ring valued locally for insurance and the replacement value is way higher than what I paid; talk about fair pricing! Oh, they even reduced the total amount to be paid when they realised that they had used less platinum than expected, saving extra bucks. Guys, no need to stress with local jewellers when you can order directly from India! Honestly, I wish there was a way to promote them everywhere to help anyone looking to propose find the best value for money."

Tejas was very helpful since the beginning of the process.\n\nWe started by selecting the diamond (carat weight, color, cut etc.). I knew the cut of the diamond that I wanted since the beginning, but he helped me get the right carat weight since I didn't want the stone either too big or too small. Tejas gave me a couple options and  ended up picking the perfect  colour and carat weight, all thanks to his help.\n\nThen he helped me with the ring setting. I showed him photos of the type of ring that I wanted and the material of the setting. At the end he gave me all the details of the ring to confirm, and time that it would be ready. Tejas helped me with the payment process which was very simple and after a few weeks he showed me a video of the ring completed.\n\nThen the ring was shipped to me. The ring was gorgeous, stunning, no words to describe it. It is all I wanted. The shape of the ring setting, the stones shining everything perfectly done. Thank you so much Tejas and EARTHLY JEWELS for all your help in creating  perfect ring. Totally recommended 10/10. I'm looking forward to starting the process of creating a few more rings with you."
